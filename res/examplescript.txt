This is a line of text.

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

One. two. three. four. five. six. seven. eight. nine. ten!

Every paragraph, separated by an empty line, starts a new speech bubble.

You can explicitly start a new line
Like this!

If you write a really really really long paragraph like this one,
and it becomes so long that it no longer fits into a single speech bubble, 
it will automatically be split into multiple speech bubbles.
This won't always work perfectly though, so don't rely on it too much.

|These| |words| |appear| |one| |at| |a| |time!|

This    line    has    longer    pauses.

Punctuation has longer pauses then regular characters:
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Someone else is speaking now.

If you don't specify a new speaker, they stay the same between paragraphs.

[Player]
And now the player is speaking.

[]
And now we're back to the original NPC you started the conversation with.

[happy] Now the NPC is very happy.

[sad] And now he's sad.

[happy] you can also make them change expressions [sad] mid paragraph.

And *These words* are in *bold*.
